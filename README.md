# About Me #
I am a programmer who loves automation. I focus on web automation, using tools like Selenium and Puppeteer. I have also developed a few custom scripts for specific tasks that needed to be automated. I enjoy working on anything from small scripts to large projects. I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills and knowledge.
